	# 6+ years exp. training & production/project env ml modeling and text mining:
		# Banking domain....
		# financial data....

	# Various tools: 
		# Client management /Coding/Scrum Master
		# Python, R, Sql, 
		# Hadoop, Cloudera, Ambari, Azure, AWS, Databricks...
		# 


		# Important and Required for coming topics....

	# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.....


	# Models to take care/simplified our requirements....

	# Example: 
		# OpenAI: very very simplified class of models: which can actually do text mining

		# Data: 

			# Input data ---- >>>>> Output data

			# salary of emp: exp of emp: 

			# 20 people: exp: 20 salary

			# equation: 
			# Input data (exp and salary of 20 emp) ---- equation >>>>> Output data
			# 10 yrs..... predict what will be salary for this emp.. output result

			# model: followers on instagram salary/pay

			# computing: processing requirement: 
							# ram/hard disk..... forecast.... 

			# Machine learning: we built equations/models automate these models based on training

			# available for free: 
				# Linear regression: model/equation .... 19th centuary..

				# train this equation/model on our data: (own) (problem statement)

				# test: if this is working fine???
				# use this for future reference.....

				# Big Mart (superstore) .... predict sales tomorrow: 
				# Product quality:  product quality 
				# Home value prediction
				# Recommend a movie (NETFLIX)
				# tRAFFIC FORECASTING
				# predict air pollution pmi
				# flipkart/amazon ...... suggest you: which product you can buy if you are already having one product in cart.... similar or associated products...

				# also bought .... headphone,, earphone, cover, extended warranty...
				# song recommendation
				# spam classifier (separate..... different quality/text based on some inputs)
				# loan eligibility prediction.... cibil score generation based on machine learning model
					

				# fake news classification with the help of Machine Learning ...
				# assocations based models: 
				# how much electricity is required on daily basis for delhi urban area... Machine Learning

				# Basics of Python: 
						# what are different data types....
						# how to load a data into python/anaconda based jupyter notebook....

				# predict ticket amount/rent based on availability of drivers/customer timing/customer pattern to pay


# Machine Learning equations: 

	# Python env.... 

	# types of machine learning models: 
			# Supervised ML: 
				# 4 models in sml
			$ Unsupervised ML
				# 4 models in Usml
				
	# inour 8 sessions...
	# Jupyter notebook....

# Supervised Machine Learning models:

Model no. 1: 

# Simple Linear Regression: 
			
			# One Independent (one input column)
			# One Dependent   (one output column
	
			# building an equation: 
					# y = dependent col
					# x = independt col

					# equation of the model: 
			
					y = b0 + b1*x

					# in our example: 

					# y = salary/ctc
					# x = years_exp

					# 13 years of exp: x ............... y ?

					# Y = b0 + b1 * 13

					# b0: intercept
					# b1: slope


					# 5.3 YEARS EXP : FIND OUT SALARY OF THAT EMPLOYEE?
