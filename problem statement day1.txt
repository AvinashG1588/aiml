HR Manager: 

Daily basis going through 100's of resumes to analyse to calculate
the joining CTC/Salary for a new Hire.

# John completed MIT AIML Course: 

# He can use models to forecast based on past data to create data driven
# process for setting of CTC/Salary for new roles!....

# Use a perfect/good models to find data driven salary prediction solution.

# 13 years of exp: what salary you will offer to that New Hire?

# Understand the data
# Transform data (fulfilling the model input data requirement)
# find an appropriate model to predict the CTC.
# Evaluate the result of his problem statement.


# equation of the model: 
			
					y = b0 + b1*x

					# in our example: 

					# y = salary/ctc
					# x = years_exp

					# 13 years of exp: x ............... y ?

					# Y = b0 + b1 * 13

					# b0: intercept
					# b1: slope
